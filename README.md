Install WordPress 4.9.5 to the machine, this is explained within the report, to gain access to the site it must be exported and available for import. The chosen method to share the project is using a WordPress All-In-One Plugin, this is a simple download from within WordPress. Once downloaded this plugin must be activated this allows it to become usable. A link for this plugin will appear on the left-hand navigation bar, this will include export and import links. Select the import link and this should open a new window that includes a drag and drop upload. Include the WordPress site file here and let it run. The WordPress site should be available for testing.
